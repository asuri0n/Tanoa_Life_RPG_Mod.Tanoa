Thanks for downloading this tool!

This Script was originally written by Fusion (https://forums.bistudio.com/user/846292-fusion13/), so all Kudos to him!
I just corrected a lot of errors and bugs and added a few features.

Please all I ask is that you do NOT abuse this, Do NOT take credit for this, and please if possible give me credit somewhere in the mission!

Best regards
